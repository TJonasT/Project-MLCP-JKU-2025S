# Project-MLCP-JKU-2025S

I created a simple git repo under https://github.com/TJonasT/Project-MLCP-JKU-2025S, let me know if you want any changes

to pull it down go to the dir where you want it and run -- git clone https://github.com/TJonasT/Project-MLCP-JKU-2025S -- (without the --)

in the repo there are 3 file types so far.
1) .gitignore - specifies what files are pushables
2) readme - for any documantaion or overall notes you want the group to have
3) jupyter notebook files (already following the great naming convention)


small intro in case you are not familiar:

to pull down data from the repo run -- git pull origin main -- (do this before pushing and in the beginning of doing work to stay up to date)

to prep you files for pushing run:
1)  -- git add yourfilename --
2)  -- git commit yourfilename -m "message_displayed_with_the_commit" --

to push your files to your repo run -- git push origin main --


if you want to create side branches or ad other files feel free
care all pushes are direct no merging set up yet
