\label{sec:Labeling Function}



For your analysis, you may focus on a subset of the 58 classes provided.



\subsection{Assess how accurately the applied labeling functions capture the intended classes. }
\label{sec:Labeling Function:a}



\subsubsection{Do the mapped classes correspond well to the free-text annotations? }
\label{sec:Labeling Function:a-1}



\subsubsection{Are the labeled events clearly audible within the indicated time regions? }
\label{sec:Labeling Function:a-2}






\subsection{Which audio features appear most useful for distinguishing between the classes of interest? }
\label{sec:Labeling Function:b}






\subsection{How well do the chosen audio features group according to the discretized class labels? }
\label{sec:Labeling Function:c}



\subsubsection{Do samples of the same class form tight clusters? }
\label{sec:Labeling Function:c-1}
