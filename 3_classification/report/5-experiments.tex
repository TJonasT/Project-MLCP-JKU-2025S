\subsection{For at least three different classifiers, systematically vary the most important hyperparameters and answer the following questions for each of them: }
\label{sec:Experiments:a}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.)]
\item How does classification performance change with varying hyperparameter values? Visualize the
change in performance.

\item (To what extent) Does overfitting or underfitting occur, and what does it depend on?
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{After selecting appropriate hyperparameters, compare the final performance estimate of the three classifiers. }
