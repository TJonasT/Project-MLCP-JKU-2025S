\subsection{For at least three different classifiers, systematically vary the most important hyperparameters and answer the following questions for each of them: }
\label{sec:Experiments:a}



\subsubsection{How does classification performance change with varying hyperparameter values? Visualize the change in performance. }
\label{sec:Experiments:a-1}



\subsubsection{(To what extent) Does overfitting or underfitting occur, and what does it depend on? }
\label{sec:Experiments:a-2}






\subsection{After selecting appropriate hyperparameters, compare the final performance estimate of the three classifiers. }
