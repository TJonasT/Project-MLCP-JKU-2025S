\label{sec:Analysing Predictions}



\subsection{Use the spectrogram and the sequence of predictions to visualize the classifier output. }
\label{sec:Analysing Predictions:a}






\subsection{Listen to the audios and inspect the corresponding predictions of the classifier. How well does the classifier recognize the classes?}
\label{sec:Analysing Predictions:b}



\subsection{What are particular problematic conditions that cause the classifier to mispredict classes? Can you think of simple postprocessing steps that might help improve the predictions?}
