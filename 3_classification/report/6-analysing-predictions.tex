\label{sec:Analysing Predictions}



Find two interesting audio files that have not been used for training and qualitatively evaluate your classifierâ€™s predictions. 



\subsection{Use the spectrogram and the sequence of predictions to visualize the classifier output. }
\label{sec:Analysing Predictions:a}






\subsection{Listen to the audios and inspect the corresponding predictions of the classifier. }
\label{sec:Analysing Predictions:b}



\subsubsection{How well does the classifier recognize the classes? }
\label{sec:Analysing Predictions:b-1}






\subsection{What are particular problematic conditions that cause the classifier to mispredict classes? }
\label{sec:Analysing Predictions:c}



\subsubsection{Can you think of simple postprocessing steps that might help improve the predictions? }
\label{sec:Experiments:c-1}
