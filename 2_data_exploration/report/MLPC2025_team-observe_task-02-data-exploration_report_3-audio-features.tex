\subsection{Which audio features appear useful? Select only the most relevant ones or perform a down projection 
for the next steps.}

\subsection{Extract a fixed-length feature vector for each annotated region as well as for all the silent parts in
between. The most straightforward way to do this is to average the audio features of the corresponding
region over time, as shown in the tutorial session.}
\label{sec:Audio Features:b}


\subsection{Cluster the audio features for the extracted regions. Can you identify meaningful clusters of audio
features? Do the feature vectors of the silent regions predominantly fall into one large cluster?}
