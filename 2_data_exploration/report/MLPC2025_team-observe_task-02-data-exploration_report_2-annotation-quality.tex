\subsection{How precise are the temporal annotations?}
\label{sec:Annotation Quality:a1}
\lipsum[1-3]


\subsection{How similar are the text annotations that correspond to the same region?}
\label{sec:Annotation Quality:b1}


\subsection{How many annotations did we collect per file? How many distinct sound events per file?}
\label{sec:Annotation Quality:a2}
\lipsum[5]

\subsection{How detailed are the text annotations? How much does the quality of annotations vary between 
different annotators?}
\label{sec:Annotation Quality:b2}


\subsection{Are there any obvious inconsistencies, outliers, or poor-quality annotations in the data? Propose a
simple method to filter or fix incorrect or poor-quality annotations (e.g., remove outliers, typos, or
spelling errors).}
