\subsection{Is the dataset useful to train general-purpose sound event detectors?}
\label{sec:Conclusions:a}

While the dataset may be useful for detecting somewhat specific sounds which fall into discovered clusters, it most likely is neither large or diverse enough nor of high enough quality for truly general use.

\subsection{Which biases did we introduce in the data collection and annotation phase?}
\label{sec:Conclusions:c}
The data collection seems to have happened by searching for recordings from specific fields (like concerts, pets, rain \& wind, ...) which probably introduced some bias. Additionally it was said that unpleasant/inappropriate recordings were specifically filtered out. As for the annotations, there definitely are some language/demographic biases which take effect in the data.
